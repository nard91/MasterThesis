\section{Limitations of the project}
%Limits of my approach

% CODEBOOK CONSTRUCTION
As explained in section \ref{subsec:Construction} one important limitation of this project is that no statical technique has been applied to control on the reliability of the codes. Through a series of meetings with James Lapalme we have checked the reliability and consistency of the codes.
% NO SCIETIFIC DEFINITIONS FOR THE DETERMINANTS IN THE CODEBOOK
One of the limitations that should be addressed in the future versions of the codebook are a definition for each determinants that comes from the research community instead that from Google. Since I believe that the result of this activity will not drastically affect the project I have listed it as one of the future works.
